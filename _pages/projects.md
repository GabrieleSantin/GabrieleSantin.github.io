Currently, part of my work is within the following projects.


### PERTURBATION PROBLEMS AND ASYMPTOTICS FOR ELLIPTIC DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
In this project we consider perturbation and asymptotic problems for elliptic differential equations. We consider several different types of perturbation: domain (regular and singular perturbation for electromagnetic, degenerate, Steklov, nonlinear and higher order problems, corner singularities, etc.), mass and geometry (eigenvalue bounds and optimization), coefficients (regularity and stability, constant/nonconstant cases). The main aim of the project is to exploit the interplay between potential theory and calculus of variations and, on a higher scale, to involve more prominently geometric ideas in unprecedented ways: we will not only study perturbation and asymptotic problems in Riemannian settings, but also apply geometric techniques for the study of problems in Euclidean spaces. Apart from actual perturbation problems, we also consider more abstract, foundational questions that are necessary to improve the understanding of the geometrical and functional structure, such as: the role of the mass from a geometric point of view; domain perturbation in a general Riemannian setting; reducible operators for solving general BVPs; numerical computation of potentials; regularity properties of layer potentials; etc.

### Data-driven discovery and control of multi-scale interacting artificial agent systems
The main goal of the project consists in developing sustainable and flexible next-generation frameworks for data-driven modelling, optimization, and simulation of multi-scale interacting agent systems of utmost importance in industrial applications and socio-economic life. As scientific aim, we investigate several approaches relying on learning-based mathematical methods to build and control physical data-driven models.
The proposal is timely since learning-based methods have recently attracted the attention of the scientific community to fully exploit HPC hardware and the abundance of data, demanding new unifying concepts to address grand challenges.
