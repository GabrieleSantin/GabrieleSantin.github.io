I’m a Researcher in the MobS Lab at the Center for Information and Communication Technology of the Fondazione Bruno Kessler in Trento (IT).

I work with the RSDE and DCL labs to develop Machine Learning solutions and algorithms for the exploitation of different data sources and modeling techniques within the “City Sensing” project.

I’m also a junior participating researcher in the Cluster of Excellence Data-integrated Simulation Science, where I’m a member of the Project Network Machine Learning for Simulation.

Previously, I’ve been for four years in the group of Bernard Haasdonk at the University of Stuttgart, working on kernel based algorithms and their application to the surrogate modelling of complex simulations.

I obtained my MSc and PhD at the Department of Mathematics of the University of Padova under the supervision of Stefano De Marchi in the CAA group, where I wrote my theses on algorithmic and theoretical aspects of kernel based interpolation.


Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
