I’m an assistant professor (RTDb) at the [Department of Environmental Sciences, Informatics and Statistics](https://www.unive.it/pag/28183) at the Ca' Foscari University of Venice in Italy, where I'm also a member of the [Data-Centric Environmental Studies Center (DESC)](https://www.unive.it/web/en/15222/home).

I work on Approximation Theory and Machine Learning, and on their combination for the solution of problems in simulation sciences. 

I’m also an Associated Member in the [Cluster of Excellence Data-integrated Simulation Science](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/), where I’m a member of the project network [Machine Learning for Simulation](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/exc/research/pn/pn6/).

Previously, I’ve been a researcher at the [Digital Society Center](https://www.fbk.eu/it/digital-society/) of FBK in Trento, Italy, and a postdoc at the [Institute of Applied Analysis and Numerical Simulation](https://www.ians.uni-stuttgart.de/) of the University of Stuttgart, Germany. 

I obtained my MSc and PhD at the Department of Mathematics of the University of Padova under the supervision of Stefano De Marchi in the CAA group, where I wrote my theses on algorithmic and theoretical aspects of kernel based interpolation.
